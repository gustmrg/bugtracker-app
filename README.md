### :trophy: About the Project

BugTracker is a system designed for tracking issues and bugs. It is commonly used in large organizations, especially in collaborative or distributed environments. However, it can also be utilized by individuals for personal time management and productivity tracking.

This system includes resource allocation, time tracking, priority management, and workflow supervision. Additionally, it provides a centralized issue log to enhance efficiency and accountability.

This project was built using C# and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern with .NET 8.0. It adopts a code-first approach, featuring user registration and role-based access control for security.

Throughout the development process, best practices such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), SOLID principles, and Dependency Injection were applied to ensure maintainability and scalability.
